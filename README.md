The present project refers to the journal paper by A. Pietrini et al., "A statistical approach to detect protein complexes at X-ray Free Electron Laser facilities.", Communications Physics, volume 1, Article number: 92 (2018).

The link to the paper is the following: https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-018-0092-6. 

The script "hitfinder.py" is meant to process the raw data contained in the file cxidb-78.cxi tha can be found
in the CXIDB - Coherent Imaging Data Bank (http://www.cxidb.org/browse.html).

The files contained in the folder "files" have been obtained with another version of this script.
For a matter of simplicity and readability, those have been given in the cxidb-78.cxi and are used by the script "hitfinder.py"
without the need of recalculating them.
